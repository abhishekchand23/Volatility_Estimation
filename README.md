# A Computational Method to Generate a Family of Extreme-Value Volatility Estimators

A framework is developed to construct estimators of volatility derived from extreme
prices of a security, such as high, low, opening, and closing prices, using null space
decomposition. This framework not only reproduces the classical estimators, such as
the Parkinson (1980) and Garman and Klass (1980) estimators, but also improves the
efficiency of some of the classical estimators, including the Parkinson (1980) estimator.
The estimator that utilizes only high and low prices, as derived from this method,
achieves a 17% reduction in variance compared to Parkinson (1980), which also utilizes
high and low prices. Extension of this framework is possible to cases where prices are
observed to drift and discontinuities in prices exist, due to the close of the trading day.
