#A Computational Method to Generate Family of Extreme Value Volatility Estimators

An algorithm to construct a family of unbiased extreme value volatility estimators is developed
when the log prices of assets follow simple Brownian motion with drift and jump. From this family
of estimators, the minimum variance estimator can be computed and is found to be competitive to
the estimator of Parkinson. This technique also constructs an estimator which is best in the class of
estimators that use just the high and low price of an asset. Other volatility estimators of Garman
& Klass, Yang & Zhang and Rogers & Satchell are recovered. The novelty of this approach is that
it is constructive and, moreover it can be extended to compute estimators when prices follow more
realistic models.
